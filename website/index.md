# discrete1

1D Discrete Ordinates Multigroup Neutron Transport in Python.

- Spatial Discretization: Diamond Difference
- Temporal Discretization: Backward Euler, BDF2
- Multigroup Convergence: Source Iteration, DMD
- K-eigenvalue Convergence: Power Iteration

> Experimental features: DJINN, SVD-DJINN, and a collision-based HYBRID method for accelerated and data-efficient neutron transport.

## Get Started

- Install: `pip install discrete1`
- Read the docs: see the sidebar or jump to the [API (Sphinx)]({{ site.baseurl }}/sphinx/index.html)
