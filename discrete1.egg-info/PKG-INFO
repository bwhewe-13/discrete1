Summary: One Dimensional Neutron Transport Equation for both fixed sources         and criticality problems. The discrete ordinates (SN) method discretizes         the angles, finite difference (diamond difference) discretizes the         spatial dimensions, and BDF1/BDF2 for the temporal dimensions. Spatial          geometries can be slab or sphere. Machine learning techniques and C code          functions are used for acceleration.
