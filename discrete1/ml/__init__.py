"""discrete1.ml.

Model for machine learning acceleration of 1D neutron transport solver.

An optional subpackage providing machine learning tools to accelerate
the discrete1 neutron transport solver. This package includes data
processing utilities, model training and prediction functions, and
error metrics specifically designed for DJINN-based models.

It can be installed via the 'ml' extra:

    pip install discrete1[ml]

The package depends on scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and DJINNML for
modeling capabilities.
